### Week 3

Our code is organized as:
```
├── task1_1.py : optical flow with block matching 
├── task1_2.py : off-the-shelf optical flow  
├── task1_3.py : object tracking with optical flow

├──task_2_1: 
├──task_2_2: 
└──task_2_3:
```

- Task 1.1 & 1.3
Run task1_1.py and task_1_3finetune.py. The latter needs to be run after the first since the first one includes code to extract the frames from the given video. Due to the total size of the extracted frames, these were not added directly to this repository. The user needs to specify the path to the video in the python file.



## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust framework for object tracking using the Kalman Filter algorithm. By combining prediction and update steps with data association and tracker maintenance, it effectively tracks objects in dynamic environments.
